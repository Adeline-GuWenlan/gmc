# Amendment 3 — plane floor, the shared case, long range, timings

Worklog for the P1–P5 chain on branch `height-planefloor`. Append as things happen.

## P1 — the plane floor and the timing module

**Standing caveat, repeated in every artefact this stage produces:** the plane floor is a
**user-approved manual scene-definition change** ("地面的高斯用大平面替代，手动解决噪音 for now").
It is surgery on the scene, not a reconstruction improvement and not an outer approximation with a
guarantee. Results on the edited scene are sound *with respect to the edited scene*; the gap between
that and the room is the open research question (`height_map_diagnosis.md` §4).

### 2026-09-17 19:1x — start

- Read `_rules.md`, Amendment 3, the main plan's Global Constraints + Stage bookkeeping,
  `height_map_diagnosis.md`, `README.md`. No `state/P1.json` existed, so this is a first run, not a
  resubmission.
- Inventory of what P1 builds on:
  - `showcase_scene._occupancy` / `BANDS` / `CELL = 0.05` — the band rasteriser the diagnosis used
    (through the cached `maps.npz`, which `--step maps` writes from the same function).
  - `gmc/results/height/diagnosis/map_diagnosis.json` — the numbers to reproduce.
  - `/scratch/wg2381/splathjb/gmc/outputs/height/a4/legs_check.py` and `table_frames.py` — the
    (uncommitted) A4 scripts behind `floor_rule_legs_check.json`; P1c reuses their method.
  - `showcase_scene._support_raster` + `project_scene` — the certified-map raster for P1c/P1d.

### 2026-09-17 ~20:0x — P1a: what the diagnosis number actually measures

- The session was resumed without its history (`state/P1.json` existed with `passed: []`, notes
  saying the reading was done). Judged the predecessor by artefacts, per `_rules.md`: it had left
  `planefloor.py`, `test_height_planefloor.py`, `planefloor_build.py` and `planefloor_step.sbatch`
  **uncommitted and never run**. Kept the code, split it into the per-task commits P1 requires.
- Found while reading `_occupancy`: the bands are **horizontal slabs above the scalar `z_floor`**,
  but the floor of this scene is a *tilted plane* (0.285° residual after the gravity rotation).
  tan(0.285°) × 25 m ≈ ±6.4 cm, i.e. most of the [0.02, 0.10] band. So wherever the fitted plane
  rises above `z_floor + 0.02`, the sweeper band contains **the floor surface itself**. That is a
  mechanism for the 40.7 %, it is not "reconstruction noise", and it predicts the plane-floor edit
  will work: the inserted plane is clamped flat below `z_floor + 0.02` everywhere by construction.
  `step_diagnose` now reports phantom rate binned by fitted-plane height so the mechanism is
  measured, not asserted.
